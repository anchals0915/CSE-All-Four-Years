# Angular Js and Node Js Lab 

Angular is a front-end framework for building dynamic, single-page web applications. It enables developers to create modular and maintainable code using TypeScript, offering a rich set of tools for building robust user interfaces.
 
Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. It's known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js is commonly used for building backend services and APIs in JavaScript.

2.  Develop an AngularJS application that displays a list of shopping items. Allow users to add and remove items from the list using directives and controllers. Default values for items may be included in the program.
3.  Develop a simple AngularJS calculator application that can perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
4. Write an AngularJS application that can calculate factorial and compute square based on given user input.

#  Install the Angular 

### Option 1: Using CDN (Content Delivery Network)
You can include AngularJS directly in your HTML file using a CDN. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your AngularJS App</title>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
<!-- Your AngularJS application code goes here -->
</body>

</html>
```

### Option 2: Download and Host Locally
Visit the AngularJS download page and download the desired version.
Include the downloaded script in your HTML file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your AngularJS App</title>
  <script src="path/to/angular.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Your AngularJS application code goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

### Option 3: Using npm (Node Package Manager)
If you prefer using npm, you can install AngularJS globally or locally in your project.
    
#### To install globally
    npm install -g angular@1.8.2

#### To install locally (in your project directory)
    npm install angular@1.8.2

After installing, include the script in your HTML:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your AngularJS App</title>
  <script src="node_modules/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Your AngularJS application code goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```
