# AngularJS Shopping Items Application - Lab Experiment No: 2

## Aim
Develop an AngularJS application that displays a list of shopping items. Allow users to add and remove items from the list using directives and controllers. Default values for items may be included in the program.

## Introduction
In this lab experiment, we aim to create an AngularJS application for managing a list of shopping items. Users should have the ability to add and remove items from the list, and default values for items may be included in the program.

## Directives Used

### 1. `ng-repeat`
The `ng-repeat` directive repeats a set of HTML a specified number of times, once for each item in a collection. The collection can be an array or an object.

### 2. `ng-options`
The `ng-options` directive is used to fill a `<select>` element with `<options>`. It is particularly useful for populating dropdown lists with data from an array.

### 3. `ng-click`
The `ng-click` directive specifies the behavior when an HTML element is clicked. It defines what AngularJS should do in response to the user's click.

## Methods Used

### 1. `splice()`
The `splice()` method is used to add and/or remove elements from an array. It provides a way to modify the contents of an array by adding or removing elements at a specific index.

### 2. AngularJS Array Push Values
The `push()` method in AngularJS is used to add an element to the end of an array. This method is employed for dynamically adding items to the shopping list.

### 3. `indexOf()`
The `indexOf()` method returns the first index (position) of a specified value in an array. If the value is not found, it returns -1. The search can start at a specified index and proceed from left to right.
