# AngularJS application Factorial and Square - Lab Experiment No: 4

## Aim

Write an AngularJS application that can calculate factorial and compute square based on given user input.

## Introduction

In this lab experiment, the goal is to create an AngularJS application that calculates the factorial and computes the square based on user input. The application will showcase the use of if...else statements and different types of loops.

### If...else Statement

An if statement can be followed by an optional else block. The else block will execute if the Boolean expression tested by the if statement evaluates to false.

### Syntax
```javascript
if (boolean_expression) {
    // statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true
} else {
    // statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false 
}
```

+   The if block guards the conditional expression.
+   The block associated with the if statement is executed if the Boolean expression evaluates to true.
+   The if block may be followed by an optional else statement.
+   The instruction block associated with the else block is executed if the expression evaluates to false.


### Loops
Loops are essential in programming when a block of code needs to be executed several times. Different types of loops are provided by programming languages to handle looping requirements.

### Classification of Loops
+   Definite Loop: A loop whose number of iterations are definite/fixed. The for loop is an implementation of a definite loop.
+   Indefinite Loop: An indefinite loop is used when the number of iterations in a loop is indeterminate or unknown.

### Types of Loops
+   For Loop: The for loop is an implementation of a definite loop.
+   While Loop and Do...While: Can be executed in a definite number of conditions.
